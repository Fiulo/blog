## Key Features of Pikaso

Pikaso offers a range of features designed to enhance the creative experience:

- Real-time image creation and editing through simple drawing.
- Turning ideas into breathtaking visuals with descriptive prompts, including scenery, lighting, style, colors, and more.
- Access to a library of icons, shapes, and elements to enhance creativity.
- Suitable for users with varying drawing skills, as the AI can transform even the most basic sketches into impressive art.

## How Pikaso Works

Pikaso works by allowing users to draw a quick sketch, which serves as a basis for the AI-generated art. The AI then interprets the sketch and generates a unique image based on the user's prompts. Users can refine their drawings and prompts to guide the AI in generating the desired artwork.

## Benefits of Using Pikaso

Using Pikaso has several advantages:

- Encourages creativity and experimentation by allowing users to visualize their ideas quickly and easily.
- Saves time by generating high-quality images in seconds.
- Offers a wide range of styles and elements to customize the generated art.

## Limitations and Pricing

Freepik's AI image generator allows users to create three images for free every day. After the free image generations, users can continue browsing and download other AI-generated images from the public Freepik. Users can also edit their images with Freepik's built-in photo editor.

## Conclusion

Pikaso is set to revolutionize the creative process by harnessing the power of AI-generated art. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, Pikasso is an exciting tool for artists, designers, and anyone looking to explore their creativity. Give Pikaso a try and experience the magic of art and AI for yourself.
