In recent years, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought about a new form of art- AI generated art. However, there have been debates surrounding the ethics of such art, with some claiming that it is wrong or unethical. However, I believe these claims are misguided, and there is nothing ethically wrong with AI generated art.</p><p><strong>Ethics:</strong></p><p>Firstly, AI art is transformative. AI algorithms use various techniques such as deep learning, generative adversarial networks, and neural style transfer to create unique pieces of art that are distinct from their source material. The AI algorithms process the input data and create a new representation, giving birth to a unique piece of art that can stand on its own. This transformation is similar to how human artists use existing sources of inspiration to create something new and unique.</p><p>Moreover, human artists also draw inspiration from other artists' work, and nothing can truly be original. Artists have been inspired by each other's work for centuries, and this has led to the development of new styles, techniques, and forms of art. In a similar vein, AI algorithms use existing artworks as reference materials, but the end product is a new and unique piece of art.<br>Furthermore, AI art differs from its source materials. AI algorithms have the ability to process vast amounts of data and create something new and distinct from its source material. While some AI generated art may have similarities with existing works, the end product is always different and unique. The same is true for human artists who use reference materials and copy other artists' styles. The end product is always different and reflects the artist's own creative vision.</p><p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p><p>In my experience, AI generated art is a great tool that can help people who don't have as much time to create, share their ideas with the world. However, I have experienced some limitations, such as its inability to follow very precise prompts accurately, in particular, prompts that explicitly specify multiple characters and objects performing specific actions. A simple example for such a prompt I have used on Midjourney would be: A man in a red spacesuit on the moon riding a unicycle while holding a banana heading towards a rocketc. The resulting image turned out to be something surreal and missed parts of the prompt, such as showing a bike or scooter instead of a unicycle. This is something I have experienced many times. It also frequently makes mistakes with faces and body parts. However, tools such as GFPGAN and the Stable Diffusion face restore feature have the ability to rectify this problem to some extent.</p><p><strong>Final thoughts:</strong></p><p>In conclusion, technology is constantly changing, and similar complaints have been made about other forms of technology such as photography and image editing software. However, these technologies have become an integral part of the art world, and AI generated art is no different. AI algorithms have the ability to create unique and transformative pieces of art that stand on their own. There is ethically nothing wrong with AI generated art, and it should be appreciated and celebrated for its unique contributions to the art world. It is a shame that some people feel, such technology will replace their jobs, however it is important to remember that as of now, AI art tools have limitations and there are still plenty of things humans can do that such tools cannot.</p><p>It is important to note that my stance on AI generated art is in no way an attack on the art community. Artists, whether they create works entirely with their own talent, assisted by digital editing and painting tools, or by writing prompts for AI, are true visionaries who have the ability to create beauty and evoke emotions through their work. Art is not only a form of expression, but it is also a source of joy and relaxation for many people. Whether it's through painting, drawing, photography, or any other medium, art has the power to bring people together and create a sense of community. I have the utmost respect for artists and their contributions to society, and I believe that the integration of AI in the art world can only add to the beauty and diversity of the art world.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 7, 2023</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer><nav class="pagination"><div class="pagination__title"><span>Read other posts</span></div><div class="pagination__buttons"><a href="https://blog.fiulo.com/my-dream-of-the-future.html" class="btn previous" rel="prev" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  My Dream of the Future "><span class="btn__icon">←</span> <span class="btn__text">My Dream of the Future</span> </a><a href="https://blog.fiulo.com/enhance-your-workflow-with-upscayl.html" class="btn next" rel="next" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  Enhance Your Workflow with Upscayl "><span class="btn__text">Enhance Your Workflow with Upscayl</span> <span class="btn__icon">→</span></a></div></nav></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__inner"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© 2024 Powered by Publii CMS :: <a href="https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Theme</a> ported by the <a href="https://getpublii.com/customization-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Publii Team</a></p></div></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.fiulo.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=74fad06980c30243d91d72c7c57fcdb8"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
