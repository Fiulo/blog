It's called Upscayl, and I've been using it for several months now.</p><p>If you're not familiar with image upscaling, it's the process of increasing the size of a digital image without losing quality or detail. This can be especially useful if you need to print an image at a larger size or use it in a higher resolution format, but don't have access to the original high-resolution image.</p><p>That's where Upscayl comes in. It's a free AI-based image upscaling tool that's similar to Gigapixel, but without the cost and with a simpler user interface. What's more, it can batch upscale images up to four times their original size in just a few seconds.</p><p>I have found this tool to be incredibly valuable in my workflow, as it allows me to quickly and easily upscale multiple images at once, without sacrificing quality. The results are impressive, with images that look sharp and detailed even at larger sizes.</p><p>But perhaps the best thing about Upscayl is how easy it is to use. All you need to do is upload your images, select the desired output size, and hit the upscale button. The tool takes care of the rest, and you'll have your upscaled images ready to go in no time.</p><p>Overall, I would highly recommend Upscayl to anyone who works with digital images. Whether you're a photographer, graphic designer, or just someone who likes to tinker with images, this tool is sure to be a valuable addition to your workflow. So give it a try and see for yourself how it can help take your images to the next level. I hope this tool is of use to you as much as it has been to me.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl">Upscayl</a></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 7, 2023</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer><nav class="pagination"><div class="pagination__title"><span>Read other posts</span></div><div class="pagination__buttons"><a href="https://blog.fiulo.com/my-thoughts-on-the-state-of-ai-generated-art.html" class="btn previous" rel="prev" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  My Thoughts on the State of AI Generated Art "><span class="btn__icon">←</span> <span class="btn__text">My Thoughts on the State of AI Generated Art</span> </a><a href="https://blog.fiulo.com/unleash-your-creative-potential-never-run-out-of-art-ideas-with-the-help-of-ai.html" class="btn next" rel="next" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  Unleash Your Creative Potential: Never Run out of Art Ideas with the Help of AI "><span class="btn__text">Unleash Your Creative Potential: Never Run out of Art Ideas with the Help of AI</span> <span class="btn__icon">→</span></a></div></nav></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__inner"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© 2024 Powered by Publii CMS :: <a href="https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Theme</a> ported by the <a href="https://getpublii.com/customization-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Publii Team</a></p></div></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.fiulo.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=74fad06980c30243d91d72c7c57fcdb8"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
